# Redux Pomodoro Clock

### A countdown timer that alternates between work and break periods.

I re-made my original React Pomodoro Clock using Redux.  

The difficult part was all the setup involved:
- importing react-redux and creating the Redux store,
- writing the actions, action-creators, and reducers,
- using mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps in the necessary components

However, once I had it up and running, Redux was a very simple way of managing state and I look forward to working with it more.
